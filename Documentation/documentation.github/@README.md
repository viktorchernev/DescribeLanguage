Describe is a markup language used to write and maintain complex data lists that are compiled on demand to html, xml, sql, json and any other language needed. Describe is simple to use, intuitive and easy to master, and readily extendible.


## How to
In order to run the `DescribeCompilerCLI.exe` you need a Windows PC with DotNet framework version 4.8 or higher. In order to reference the `DescribeCompilerAPI.dll` in your DotNet projects, you need to target DotNet framework version 4.8 or higher. There are no other dependencies. Also, be sure to check out our [wiki](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki) for the complete documentation.  
  
### 0. Set up highlighting
In order to highlight Describe code, you can download the xml files for Notepad++ from the folder [Highlighting](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/tree/master/%23DescribeLanguage/Highlighting), or use the instructions provided in said folder to set up your preferred text editor.
  
### 1. Write Describe code  
Write a title of each list, followed by an arrow `->` and the elements, one on a line, separated by comma `,` and end with a semicolon `;`. Add `[links]` in square brackets, and `<tag>` items in order to piece lists together. Add additional data as `{decorators}` in curly brackets. For more info visit the [documentation](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki/Grammar-How-To) or explore Describe source codes and test cases in this [huge collection](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DataLists/tree/master/Lists).

### 2a. [Compile (using CLI)](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki/CliCompiler-how-to)  
Run the CLI compiler by specifying the target folder (or file) as first argument and output file (or folder) as second argument.  Add [options](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki/CliCompiler-how-to) after that, if needed.

### 2b. [Compile (using API)](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki/ApiCompiler-how-to)
### 2c. [Compile (using AWS)](https://github.com/viktorchernev/DescribeCompiler/wiki/AwsCompiler-how-to)


### 3. Result  
The final output will depend on the translator used - and you can easily write your own translator, or use the ones that are prebuilt for you. Here we are using a set of particular HTML templates to build a bare-bone website.
