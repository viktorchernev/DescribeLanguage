# Describe Compiler versions

## Versioning
The Describe Compiler project uses semantic versioning. The Describe compiler is currently in a version 0.9 which is an open beta. 


## change-log
* [[v 0.9/Compiler v0.9]]
* [[v 0.9.1/Compiler v0.9.1]]
* [[v 0.9.2/Compiler v0.9.2]]
* [[v 0.9.3/Compiler v0.9.3]]
* [[v 0.9.4/Compiler v0.9.4]]


## History
First, a simple and rudimentary mock application was hacked together, that was called "Test Gadget". It had no real parser engine and used simple logic. In time it grew in complexity and became the Describe Compiler. Below is the source code, as a curiosity.
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v3]]
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v4]]
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v4.1]]
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v5]]
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v6]]
* [[test gadget/TestGadget v6.1]]
