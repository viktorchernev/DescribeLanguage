_FEATURE: Implement ext command_

The describe compiler should come with a folder with templates. However, it also has those (or at least some of those) templates as embedded resources in the exe. Whether we don't have the templates folder for some reason, or we have made changes that we want to reset, we can use the "ext" command in order to make the compiler produce a new copy of the Templates folder, in the same folder that it is. Be ware that the command will overwrite existing files
