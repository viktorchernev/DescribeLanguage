XML files for Notepad++ highlighting are present in this folder, and I will add such files for other editors, when available. Meanwhile, you can use the instructions below to set the highlighting in your favourite editor manually - it shouldn't be too difficult. You can use different colors if you like, of course.

* Color keywords dark blue. Keywords are commas "," semicolons ";" and production arrows "->" 
* Color comments green and make italic. Allow comments anywhere and allow comments folding. Line comments start with two forward slashes "//" and end with a new line symbol "\n". Delimited comments start with a forward slash and a star "/\*" and end with a star and a forward slash "\*/"  
* Color tags dark blue as well, and make bold. Tags are groups that start with lesser then symbol "<" and end with a greater then symbol ">"  
* Color decorators purple or cyan or magenta. Decorators are groups that start with curly bracket "{" and end with a curly bracket "}"  
* Color links red. Links start with square bracket "\[" and end with square bracket "\]"
* Optionally, add one more group to color text in regular brackets in light-gray "(" and ")"
