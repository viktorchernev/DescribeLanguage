<br>_FEATURE: Artifacts_

Artifacts are compiled snippets that are kept at a specified location, that are used in the compilation process instead of recompiling anew, in case there is no change to the original file

<span style="color:blue">Properties have been implemented - ```ArtifactMode``` and ```ArtifactsPath``` in ```DescribeCompiler#Properties.cs``` However, the functionality to use artifacts have not been implemented yet.</span>
