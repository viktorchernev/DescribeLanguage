FEATURE: way to view redefinitions and cannons "!"
With the current implementation, if one item has different literals in different lists (but same tag, otherwise it won't be the same item), its literal gets overwritten every time, and nothining is reported whatsoever. This is an inherent problem with the describe language, called the redefinition problem.
Those redefinitions should be reported in the logs. Also, tags might be marked with an exclamation mark at the beginning of the id, thus marking this item variant as "cannon", and throwing an error if same tag id is cannonized more than ones - in this way, in effect user is saying - I might have different variations of an item, but this is marked as the one to be used (cannon), and others serve as hints that are overwritten.
