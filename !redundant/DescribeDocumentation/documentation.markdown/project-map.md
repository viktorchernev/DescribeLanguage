1. Project Listiary

The "Listiary" project is a software project that aims at developing a wiki of interconnected lists and a markup language for that wiki. In essence, the project consists of two parts
or sub-projects - the language and the wiki. This document describes the what, where and why about "Listiary" and the "Describe" language.

2. Describe markup language
The Describe markup language is a markup language that is designed to write and maintain complex data lists that are then compiled to other languages, like html, xml, sql, json and other. It is very small and simple language that does not require dedicated learning - much like "wiki markup" or "markdown". The Describe language consists of three projects - the language, the compiler and the library.
