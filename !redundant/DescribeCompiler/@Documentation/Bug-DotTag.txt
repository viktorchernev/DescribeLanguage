This file broke something because of the "<inventions.rnode>" tag.
We got this error when trying to load compiled JSON
Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected ',' or ']' after array element at line 1 column 557862 of the JSON data
This is because there is no comma between 2 items - "}{" instead of "},{"
This is probably due to putting 2 base nodes in the root file
However, it is still mishandled by the translator and needs to be investigated!
