This list explains the contents of the basic test files for Describe version 1.0 "Lines".
Describe version 0.9, as well as version 0.6 and 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 should pass as well, in order to prove backward compatibility. 
These tests are not extensively covering all possible edge cases, but keep in mind that we have a hundreds of files in the Describe library, that will serve as a test as well.


A. Basics

	Category A tastes the fact that in this version of the language, single commas ',', semicolons ';', 
	and producers '->' are parsed as part of the data.
	
	A_control.ds - We want to test a simple Describe list to start with, as a control. Nothing special here
	A_inner_commas1.ds - One inner comma.
	A_inner_commas2.ds - Multiple inner commas, including at the start of an entry.
	A_inner_commas3.ds - Multiple inner commas, including before producer and separator.
	A_semicolons1.ds - One inner semicolon.
	A_semicolons2.ds - Multiple inner semicolons, including at the start of an entry.
	A_semicolons3.ds - Multiple inner semicolons, including before producer and separator.
	A_producers1.ds - One inner producer.
	A_producers2.ds - Multiple inner producers, including at the start of an entry.
	A_producers3.ds - Multiple inner producers, including before producer and separator.
	A_tilde.ds - A tilde inversion.


B. Whitespaces before new lines

	These test files of category B intend to test if having different kinds of white spaces 
	before new lines in operators interferes with the functionality.

	B_spaces.ds - Spaces before new lines in producer, separator, terminator. Multiple spaces before separator.
	B_tabs.ds - Tabs before new lines in producer, separator, terminator. Multiple tabs before separator.
	B_exotic_spaces.ds - Single exotic spaces before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.


C. Comments before new lines

	These test files of category C intend to test if having different kinds of comments 
	before new lines in operators interferes with the functionality.

	C_line_comment.ds - Line comments before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.
	C_block_comment.ds - Block comments before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.
	C_multiple_line_comment.ds - Multiple line comments before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.
	C_multiple_block_comment.ds - Multiple block comments before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.
	C_multiple_mixed_comment.ds - Multiple line and block comments before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.
	C_comments_and_spaces.ds - Multiple line and block comments and spaces before new lines in producer, separator, terminator.


D. Double symbols

	Files in this category tests the functionality of double symbols as separators, producers and terminators.

	D_commas.ds - Same line commas with various spaces before and after.
	D_semicolons.ds - Same line terminators with various spaces before and after.
	D_producers.ds - Same line producers with various spaces before and after.


E. Escaped double symbols

	E_escaped_double_commas.ds - Same line commas with various spaces before and after, with one of the symbold escaped.
	E_escaped_double_semicolons.ds - Same line terminators with various spaces before and after, with one of the symbold escaped.
	E_escaped_double_producers.ds - Same line producers with various spaces before and after, with one of the symbold escaped.
