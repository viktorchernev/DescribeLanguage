// After we have parsed our files and optimized the resulting parse tree to content in an Unfold
// structure, we might want to translate this unfold structure to a desired language (like HTML,
// or JSON e.g.) This is where Translators come into play.
//
// Previously (before v0.9.2) translators were a part of the compilation process itself, which
// limited flexibility and made implementation of custom translators harder.
