FEATURE:Group escapes
There should be a way to escape a whole line or multiple lines - in efect saying that this whole line or whole text is a single literal
The thilde symbol is appropriate for that:
Single Line escaper should be a line that starts with a thilde "~" and end with the new line symbol.
Multy line group escape should start with "~~" and end with "~~" or "~~" and a new line.
