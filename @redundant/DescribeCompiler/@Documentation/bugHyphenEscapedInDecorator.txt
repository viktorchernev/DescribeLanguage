BUG: We are escaping hyphens inside decorators. Why?
Because we are escaping them everywhere with the new preprocessor for Describe 1.0
This did not matter for comments, but it does matter for the decorators, and to a lesser extent for links and tags (not much at all)

Hacked some code in place, but will need to be fixed.
