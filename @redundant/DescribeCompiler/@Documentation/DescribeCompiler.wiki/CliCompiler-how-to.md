To use the Command Line Interface (CLI) parser, simply provide target file or folder path (depending on weather you are parsing a single file, or a folder of files) followed by an output file path. Alternatively, you car run the "help" command to display help message. Some options are available as well.  
  
usage:  
`describe help`  
`describe INPUT_PATH [verbosity=<verb>] OUTPUT_PATH`  
  
options:  
**_help_** - display this message  
**_verbosity_** - set the log verbosity of the parser:  
* **_l_**, _low_ - low verbosity  
* **_m_**, _medium_ - medium verbosity  
* **_h_**, _high_ - high verbosity
